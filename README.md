Based on the provided information, it seems like you're looking for a substance that determines the mechanical strength and stiffness of wood along different directions. However, the text you've provided primarily discusses the processing and properties of delignified wood in its morphing state, with a focus on its plastic formability and the slip-off mechanism between fibers.
To find information about the substance providing mechanical strength and determining the stiffness of wood along different directions, let's navigate to another section called "Mechanical Properties of Wood":

### Mechanical Properties of Wood
Wood is an orthotropic material, meaning its mechanical properties vary depending on the direction of measurement. The following table summarizes the Young's modulus (E), shear modulus (G), and strength properties of wood in different directions:

| Property       | Longitudinal (L) | Radial (R) | Tangential (T) |
|----------------|-----------------|-----------|---------------|
| **Young's Modulus (GPa)** | 10 - 30      | 1 - 2.5     | 0.4 - 1       |
| **Shear Modulus (GPa)**   | 0.8 - 2.5    | 0.3 - 0.9  | 0.2 - 0.6     |
| **Tensile Strength (MPa)**| 100 - 400    | 2 - 10     | 0.4 - 2       |
| **Shear Strength (MPa)**  | 5 - 30      | 0.8 - 3    | 0.6 - 2      |

From this table, we can see that the stiffness (Young's modulus) and strength of wood vary significantly along different directions. The substance responsible for these mechanical properties is primarily the cell wall material composed of cellulose (40-50%), hemicellulose (20-30%), and lignin (20-30%). Cellulose, in particular, provides the stiffness and strength due to its highly crystalline and fibrillated structure.
Now that we've found the relevant information about the substance providing mechanical strength and determining the stiffness of wood along different directions, would you like more details on any specific property or direction?
