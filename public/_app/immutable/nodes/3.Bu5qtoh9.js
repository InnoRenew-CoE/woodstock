The project is currently validating its technologies and strategies in three diverse pilot cities—Berlin (Germany), Baia Mare (Romania), and Siena (Italy)—to demonstrate how timber can be integrated into different urban contexts and heritage settings.",image:"./timberhaus.svg",link:"https://timberhaus.eu"},{title:"IoT Platform",description:"Our IoT platform collects and aggregates data from connected devices in real time, transforming it into clear, actionable insights.
